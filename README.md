Data Mining for Predicating ATM Machines Faults

A web application for predicting ATM problems is desirable for banks.
Some classical machine learning models (e.g. Random Forests) are used for prediction based on the log files of ATM machines.

Banks aim at providing 24-hour daily ATM services. This web interface offers a method to predict ATM problems; To predict whether they will run into a problem on a specific day or not.

Prediction is based on some learning models trained upon features derived from ATM supervision log files. This project was undertaken as my B.Sc. thesis at Amirkabir University of Technology under supervision of Professor Reza Safabakhsh <safa@aut.ac.ir>
